Music Term: - A contrapuntal composition for two or more voices or parts built around a theme, which is successively imitated by entries of each voice at the  beginning and developed throughout the piece. The initial entry in the tonic  key is called the subject. The second entry in the dominant is called the  answer. If this answer is exact (e.g. it reproduces the subject note for note in  the dominant) then it is a real answer. If the answer is slightly modified to  preserve tonality, it is called a tonal answer. After having announced the  subject or answer, each voice passes on to another thematic element known as  the countersubject. After each voice has made its initial entry the cxposition  or first section of the fugue is complete. Thereafter, further entries of the  subject appear, separated by contrapuntal episodes and the subject may be  treated by augmentation, diminution, inversion, etc. J.S. Bach was one of the  great masters of the fugue*fugue
